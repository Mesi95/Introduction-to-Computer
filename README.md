# Introduction-to-Computer
1. <b> What are transistors? </b>
A transistor is a semiconductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow. It also used as an amplifier or switch for the electrical signals

2. <b>Moor’s law</b>
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development.

3. <b>Lambda calculus </b>
Lambda calculus (λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation by way of variable binding and substitution. It captures the features of a wide variety of programming languages.

4. <b>How computers work</b>
A computer regards any information as binary ones and zeros. This information are sent as electrical pulses in circuits. <br>Computer has input, processor and output. The processor has three parts the CPU, Memory and Motherboard.

5. <b>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) </b> is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages using hypertext links.
   <b>Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) </b> is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer.

6. <b>The Domain Name System (DNS)</b> is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like facebook.com or aau.edu.et. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

7. <b>SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer</b> it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details. The two systems can be a server and a client (for example, a shopping website and browser) or server to server (for example, an application with personal identifiable information or with payroll information).
It does this by making sure that any data transferred between users and sites, or between two systems remain impossible to read. It uses encryption algorithms to scramble data in transit, preventing hackers from reading it as it is sent over the connection. This information could be anything sensitive or personal which can include credit card numbers and other financial information, names and addresses.
<b>TLS (Transport Layer Security)</b> is just an updated, more secure, version of SSL. We still refer to our security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, but when you are buying SSL from DigiCert you are actually buying the most up to date TLS certificates with the option of ECC, RSA or DSA encryption.

8. <b>What is the difference between WWW and internet?</b>
WWW is pages we see when we are online. Like: www.facebook.com. Internet is a huge network of interconnected computers that TCP/IP Protocols to connect to the world.

9.<b>What is Morse code?</b>
Morse code is a telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of dots and dashes.

10.<b>How do computers identify what texts, numbers and different kinds of inputs (contextualization)?</b>
Computers convert text, image, sound and video into binary with an assigned ASCII value. Once the ASCII value is known, that value can be converted to binary code (0s and 1s).

11. <b>What is Cookie?</b>
Cookies are text files with small pieces of data that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection. This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your computer. When the cookie is exchanged between your computer and the network server, the server reads the ID and knows what information to specifically serve to you.

12. <b>How are computers hacked?</b>
Most hacking attacks occur via malware that infects victims’ computers through malicious links, corrupted attachments, or fake websites. But cybercriminals know how to hack computer systems more directly, too, especially if you don’t have firewall protection, or if you use weak passwords that leave you susceptible to password cracking techniques.

13.<b>What is URL?</b>
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc.
