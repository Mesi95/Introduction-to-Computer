# Introduction-to-Computer
1. What are transistors?
A transistor is a semiconductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow. It also used as an amplifier or switch for the electrical signals

2. Moor’s law
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development.

3. Lambda calculus
Lambda calculus (λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation by way of variable binding and substitution. It captures the features of a wide variety of programming languages.

4. How computers work
A computer regards any information as binary ones and zeros. This information are sent as electrical pulses in circuits.
Computer has input, processor and output. The processor has three parts the CPU, Memory and Motherboard.
•	CPU: Is the heart of the computer where instructions are sent and received.
•	Memory: either store bits sent to it by the CPU or return the values of those bits back to the CPU
•	Motherboard: It is a circuit board that connects the computer parts together.

5. What is the difference between WWW and internet?
WWW is pages we see when we are online. Like: www.facebook.com
Internet is a huge network of interconnected computers that TCP/IP Protocols to connect to the world.

6. What is Morse code?
Morse code is a telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of dots and dashes.

7. How do computers identify what texts, numbers and different kinds of inputs (contextualization)?
Computers convert text, image, sound and video into binary with an assigned ASCII value. Once the ASCII value is known, that value can be converted to binary code (0s and 1s).

8. What is Cookie?
Cookies are text files with small pieces of data that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection. This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your computer. When the cookie is exchanged between your computer and the network server, the server reads the ID and knows what information to specifically serve to you.

9. How are computers hacked?
Most hacking attacks occur via malware that infects victims’ computers through malicious links, corrupted attachments, or fake websites. But cybercriminals know how to hack computer systems more directly, too, especially if you don’t have firewall protection, or if you use weak passwords that leave you susceptible to password cracking techniques.
It’s not just PC hacking anymore — Macs and phones can be hacked as well. And while iPhones and Macs are usually less vulnerable to hacking due to their more tightly controlled, closed systems and in-built security protocols, they’re still not immune. And even if your physical device is secure, your social media profiles and email account can still be hacked.
Here are the most common ways that computers are hacked:
•	Phishing emails are designed to get you to click a malicious link or divulge private information.
•	Spam emails are usually more annoying than dangerous, but they may try to get you to visit illegitimate websites that harbor malware.
•	Fake websites like pharming sites try to deceive you into entering your personal details or login credentials, which can then be used to hack your devices and accounts or even steal your identity.
•	Social networks are increasingly home to malicious activity, usually in the form of phishing and variations of common Facebook scams.
•	Advertisements that look real can actually hide malware, and even genuine ads can infect your computer or even hijack your webcam to spy on you.
•	Some fake software is just useless (and generally harmless) bloatware. But other fake downloads may be vehicles for spyware and ransomware used by hackers.
•	Trojan horse malware is a program that installs malware in addition to serving the function you downloaded it for. Although you can remove a Trojan with the right tools, they’re tricky to detect, and you may not notice anything’s wrong until it’s too late. Use strong antivirus software with real-time threat-detection to identify and block threats before they do damage.

10.What is URL?
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc.
